## Description

```
Ever notice your stop loss gets hit... then price reverses immediately?

That's not bad luck. That's STOP HUNTING.

In this short, I reveal:
• How big players see your stop orders
• Why they push price just to trigger stops
• 3 ways to protect yourself

Solutions:
1. Mental stops - don't show your hand
2. Wider stops - give trades room to breathe  
3. Less obvious levels - not where everyone else places them

Stop hunting is real. But now you know how to avoid it.
