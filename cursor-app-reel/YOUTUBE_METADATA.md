## 📝 DESCRIPTION

```
Most developers are still stuck with GitHub Copilot in 2025...

But in 2026, everyone is switching to Cursor – the AI-first code editor that writes ENTIRE features like a pro.

While Copilot gives you line-by-line suggestions, Cursor understands your WHOLE project.

Watch me tell it "Add user authentication" and it creates auth files, routes, env variables, and login components – all in seconds.

✅ Full project context
✅ Multi-file edits  
✅ Built-in AI agents
✅ 100% FREE tier
