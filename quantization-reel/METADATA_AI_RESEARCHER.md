## Title
**5 Steps to Become an AI Researcher (DeepMind, OpenAI, Anthropic)**

---

## Description
```
Dream of building the next GPT-5 or Gemini? Getting into AI research at top labs like DeepMind, OpenAI, or Anthropic is hard, but there's a formula.

🚀 The Roadmap:
1. **Master the Math**: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability. You can't skip this.
2. **Code Everything**: PyTorch/JAX. Implement papers from scratch. Don't just `import transformers`.
3. **Read Research**: ArXiv daily. Understand the "why", not just the "how".
4. **Build a Portfolio**: Replicate famous papers (Transformers, DDPM, LoRA). Open source it.
5. **Research Engineering vs. Core Research**: Know the difference.

You don't need a PhD to start, but you need an obsession with understanding intelligence.
