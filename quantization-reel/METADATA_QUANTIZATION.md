## Title
**Google ML Interview: Run 70B Models on Your Phone (One Trick)**

---

## Description
```
Google ML interview question: How do you run a 70 billion parameter model on a phone?

Impossible... unless you know quantization.

📌 What you'll learn:
• Why FP32 wastes 280GB of memory
• How quantization compresses models 8x
• The math: 32 bits → 4 bits (16 buckets)
• The trade-off: 98.7% → 98.1% accuracy
• Real impact: Llama 70B on your phone

🔬 The Technique:
Map every weight to 16 discrete values.
Round to nearest bucket.
0.847 → bucket 7 → 0111 (binary)

Same intelligence. 8x smaller.
