## 📝 Description

```
Everyone is building AI. But most AI startups won't last 18 months.

So where is the REAL money in the AI gold rush? 🤔

In this video, I break down the 6 tiers of the AI economy - from the foundational infrastructure that powers everything to the flashy apps that most people build (and fail at).

📊 THE 6 TIERS:
⚡ Tier 0: Energy Infrastructure - The power behind AI
💎 Tier 1: Chips - NVIDIA, AMD, and the silicon wars
🏢 Tier 2: Data Centers - The real estate of AI
🧠 Tier 3: Foundation Models - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
⚙️ Tier 4: Infrastructure - The picks and shovels
🤖 Tier 5: Apps - Where most people play (and lose)

💡 The secret? Winners are USING AI, not building it.
