                "This breakthrough solved the data labeling bottleneck that held back AI for years.",
                "As these models scaled up with more data and computing power, they evolved from simple language models to what we now call Large Language Models, or LLMs.",

                "If a model hasn’t seen examples of a specific language or concept during training, it simply won’t have that knowledge.",

                "Transformers were invented to solve the problems of sequence-to-sequence models, which used recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for tasks like translation.",
                "These had two main components: an encoder that processes inputs and a decoder that generates outputs. Both worked sequentially, token by token.",
                "The problem is that the decoder only has access to a compressed representation of the entire input. Imagine trying to answer detailed questions about a book when all you have is a brief summary.",
                "Also, input processing and output generation are done sequentially, so it’s slow for long sequences.",
                "Transformers solved this with the attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different input tokens when generating each output token.",
                "It’s like being able to reference any page in the book while answering questions. Plus, transformers can process input tokens in parallel, making them much faster.",
                "During inference, transformers work in two steps: Prefill (processing all input tokens parallel) and Decode (generating one output token at a time).",
                "The attention mechanism uses three types of vectors: Query vectors (Q), Key vectors (K), and Value vectors (V).",
                "The model computes how much attention to give each input token by comparing the Q and K vectors. A high similarity score means that the token’s content (V) will heavily influence the output.",
                "This is why longer context windows are computationally expensive: more tokens mean more K and V vectors to compute and store.",
                "Attention is almost always multi-headed, allowing the model to focus on different groups of tokens simultaneously. In Llama-2-70B, there are 32 attention heads, for example.",
                "A complete transformer consists of multiple transformer blocks, each containing an attention module and a neural network module."

                "For some applications, figuring out evaluation can consume the majority of your development effort.",
                "It’s how you mitigate risks, uncover opportunities, and gain visibility into where your system is failing.",
                "Evaluating AI systems is significantly harder than traditional ML models because problems are complex and responses are open-ended.",
                "Foundation models are black boxes. You can only evaluate them by observing their outputs, not by understanding their internal workings.",
                "Publicly available evaluation benchmarks quickly become saturated—meaning the model achieves perfect scores—as models improve.",
                "So let’s start with some fundamental metrics used to evaluate language models during training: cross-entropy and perplexity.",
                "These metrics essentially measure how well the model predicts the next token in a sequence.",
                "Language models learn the distribution of their training data. The better a model learns this distribution, the better it becomes at predicting what comes next, resulting in lower cross-entropy.",
                "Perplexity is simply the exponential of cross-entropy. It measures the amount of uncertainty a model has when predicting the next token.",
                "While perplexity is useful for guiding training, it becomes less reliable for models that have undergone significant post-training with SFT or RLHF.",
                "For some tasks, we can perform exact evaluation where there’s no ambiguity about the correct answer, like multiple-choice questions.",
                "In coding tasks, functional correctness translates to execution accuracy: does the code run and produce the expected output?",
                "One of the most powerful and common methods for evaluating AI models in production is using another AI model as a judge.",
                "These AI Judges are fast, easy to use, and relatively cheap compared to human evaluators. They can work without reference data and can judge attributes like correctness, toxicity, and hallucinations."

                "With the increasing number of readily available foundation models, the challenge isn’t developing models but selecting the right one for your application.",
                "The selection process typically involves two key steps: Finding the best achievable performance on the task, and mapping models along a cost-performance axis.",
                "Your criteria for evaluating a model can be organized into four buckets: Domain-specific capabilities, General capabilities, Instruction-following capabilities, and Cost/latency.",
                "When evaluating models, you also need to differentiate between hard attributes (impossible to change) and soft attributes (can be improved through adaptation).",
                "A high-level workflow for model selection looks like this: Filter out models whose hard attributes don’t work for you. Use publicly available information to narrow down options. Run your own experiments. Then continually monitor in production.",
                "Most companies won’t build foundation models from scratch, so another question is whether to use commercial model APIs or host an open-source model yourself.",
                "For a model to be accessible to users, a machine needs to host and run it. The service that hosts the model and handles queries is often called the inference service.",

                "It’s the easiest and most common model adaptation technique because, unlike fine-tuning, it doesn’t change the model’s weights—you’re just telling the model what you want it to do.",
                "While it’s the most accessible entry point to AI Engineering, don’t be fooled into thinking that it’s simplistic. Effective prompt engineering requires the same experimental rigor as any machine learning task.",
                "Prompts typically consist of one or more of these components: Task Description, Examples, and The Concrete Task.",
                "How much prompt engineering you need depends on the model’s robustness to prompt perturbation.",
                "It’s also worth noting that different models have different preferred prompt structures.",
                "Teaching models what to do via prompts is known as In-Context Learning. Each example in your prompt is called a 'shot,' so we get terms like 'few-shot,' 'zero-shot,' and 'one-shot' learning.",
                "Many modern models distinguish between system prompts (task description/role) and user prompts (specific query).",
                "Key strategies for effective prompt engineering include: Write clear and explicit instructions. Ask the model to adopt a persona. Provide examples. Specify the output format. Break complex tasks into simpler subtasks. And give the model time to 'think' using Chain-of-Thought promoting.",
