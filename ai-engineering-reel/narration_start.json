                "Hey everyone, today we’re diving into the book 'AI Engineering' by Chip Huyen.",
                "800 pages of really great content about this in-demand field that’s offering salaries of $300,000 or more.",
                "In this video, I’m summarizing everything from the book to help you get a high-level overview of the field.",
                "We’ll talk about foundation models, prompt engineering, RAG, fine-tuning, agents, how to build a system, improving inference, and more.",
                "I also want to mention, this is a super high-level overview of a very detailed technical book.",
                "Don’t expect to learn all the details just from watching this video.",
                "I really recommend using this as a way to get an overview of what the field looks like and use it as a jumping-off point for your own research and exploration."

                "So what exactly is AI Engineering, and how is it different from traditional machine learning?",
                "Let’s break it down.",
                "AI Engineering has exploded recently for two simple reasons:",
                "AI models have gotten dramatically better at solving real problems, while the barrier to building with them has gotten much lower.",
                "This perfect storm has created one of the fastest-growing engineering disciplines today.",
                "At its core, AI Engineering is about building applications on top of foundation models—those massive AI systems trained by companies like OpenAI or Google.",
                "Unlike traditional machine learning engineers who build models from scratch, AI engineers leverage existing ones, focusing less on training and more on adaptation."

                "These foundation models work through a process called self-supervision.",
                "Instead of requiring humans to painstakingly label data, these models can learn by predicting parts of their input data.",
                "This breakthrough solved the data labeling bottleneck that held back AI for years.",
                "As these models scaled up with more data and computing power, they evolved from simple language models to what we now call Large Language Models, or LLMs.",
                "And they didn’t stop there; they’ve expanded to handle multiple types of data, including images and video, often becoming large multimodal models.",
                "Nowadays, we’re seeing foundation models power everything from coding assistants like GitHub Copilot to image generation tools, writing aids, customer support bots, and sophisticated data analysis systems."

                "Now that we’ve covered what AI Engineering is, let’s dig deeper into foundation models themselves: how they’re trained, how they work, and why understanding their architecture matters for AI engineers.",
                "Foundation models, at their core, can only know what they’ve been trained on.",
                "This might seem obvious, but it has profound implications.",
                "If a model hasn’t seen examples of a specific language or concept during training, it simply won’t have that knowledge.",
                "Most large foundation models are trained on web-crawled data, which brings some inherent problems.",
                "This data often contains clickbait, misinformation, toxic content, and fake news.",
                "To combat this, teams use various filtering techniques.",
                "For instance, OpenAI only used Reddit links with at least three upvotes when training GPT-2."
