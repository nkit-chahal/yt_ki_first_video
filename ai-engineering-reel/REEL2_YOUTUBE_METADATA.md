## Description

```
Fine-Tuning vs RAG - which one should you use?

Most developers think fine-tuning can teach a model new facts. It can't. Here's why:

📊 In this video:
• Parametric vs Non-Parametric Memory
• The "JPEG Problem" - why weights are lossy
• Catastrophic Forgetting explained
• The Reversal Curse
• When to ACTUALLY use Fine-Tuning

🧠 Fine-Tune for: Style, Format, Reasoning Patterns
📚 RAG for: Facts, Knowledge, Up-to-date Information

Based on "AI Engineering" by Chip Huyen.
