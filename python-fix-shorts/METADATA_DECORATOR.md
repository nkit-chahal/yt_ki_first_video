# YouTube Metadata: Decorator Pattern

## Title
**Python Decorators Explained in 30 Seconds (Stop the Spaghetti!)**

---

## Description
```
Your clean code is drowning in clutter. 🌿

Instead of copy-pasting logging code into 10 different functions...
Use the Decorator Pattern.

📌 What you'll learn:
• Why spaghetti code kills your logic
• The Open-Closed Principle (Never touch working code)
• What @ actually does under the hood
• The interview answer: func = wrapper(func)

🐍 The Pattern:
@logger
def process_data():
    ...

That's it. One line. Infinite reuse.

Clean. Pythonic. Interview-ready.

## Thumbnail Suggestions
1. **Concept:** A clean function being strangled by green "clutter code" vines with a big "@" symbol as the hero
2. **Text Overlay:** "STOP THE SPAGHETTI" or "1 Line = Infinite Reuse"
3. **Color Scheme:** Dark background, yellow accent (@), blue for code, green for clutter
